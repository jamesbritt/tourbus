  - before_tour, after_tour added by JTZemp. Runs at the beginning and
    end of each tour.

- Version 0.0.8:

  - Per-test filtering added by James Britt.

    Dave notes: Beware, there's a gotcha. TourBus will accept multiple
    tours to run (e.g. "tourbus simple login contact"), and if you
    specify filtering, you'll get the intersection of tests and tours.
    There's no way to select 'this test from this tour, and that test
    from that tour'. I think it's a great feature though because when
    you want to zero in on a specific test you're usually focused in
    on a specific tour, too.

2009-01-10:
-----------

- Added README.rdoc to examples/contact_app

- Added first example! Brain-dead Sinatra app that can be toured.

- Added test name to logging output in tour.

- Added missing tourbus.yml file to gemspec.

- Removed a bit of debugging code that printed options and then
  exited. This made actually running the app rather difficult. Heh.
  Oops.


2009-01-09:
-----------

- tourbus -l will now check see if a file in tours actually defines a
  constant by that name that inherits from Tour, as opposed to barfing
  spectacularly on files in the tour_helpers folder.

- Added a config file option. Tourbus looks for tourbus.yml in .,
  ./tours, ./config, and ~. Any options set there will be merged into
  the command-line args. (Command-line args override config file
  options, naturally.)

  Added tourbus.sample.yml to show what fields are available.
